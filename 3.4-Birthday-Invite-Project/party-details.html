            Stargazer lilies hold such a deep meaning for my wife because they are forever tied to the love and lessons she shared with her Grampy. 
            Some of her most cherished memories are of gardening side by side with him, watching those lilies bloom into something spectacular. 
            She still carries with her the pride and joy of accompanying him to competitions with the Westmorland horticultural society, where his prized stargazers took home more than one ribbon. 
            For her, these flowers are not just beautifulâ€”they are living reminders of a bond that shaped her childhood, moments filled with warmth, 
            laughter, and love that still bring a smile to her face and a tear to her eye today.

    <h2>First things First</h2>
        <p> Please feel <b>no obligation</b> to buy a gift for Andrea. Don't get me wrong, she loves presents
        and the more the merrier, but she wouldn't want her loved ones to stress over it. The same thing goes
        if you cannot attend. She would still love to hear from you, make other plans or even still receive 
        a gift I did my best to have a variety of ideas with various price ranges 
        </p>
</div>
        <p>You also don't need to get something from my pre sorted list!</p>
        <p>Get comfortable coming up with your own ideas if you like. I created the list based on theme</p>
    <h3>A Husband's insights</h3>
    <p> I spend a lot of time with Andrea. This Year I turned 30. coincedently, this Year will also mark
        10 Years that we've been together. That means 33% of my time alive has been spent blessed with 
        her presence. How cool is that?! Well anyway, The following guides items can all be found in the 
        home page's link to Amazon.

                    <P>
                    This is a great example of Andrea's favorite thing — new experiences with me. A date 
                    idea book keeps us exploring, laughing, and making memories together, which is what she treasures most.

                    <p> 
                    This is a great example of how aromatherapy can transform an ordinary evening into something soothing 
                    and restorative. Imagine lavender filling the air like a soft, calming hug, citrus notes of orange and 
                    lemon brightening the room like morning sunshine, and a hint of eucalyptus rolling in as refreshing as 
                    a cool breeze after the rain. With the right blend of scents, Andrea can turn self-care time into a 
                    little sanctuary at home.

                    <p>
                    This is a great example of how Andrea can bring the spa home with her. A spa kit turns the bathroom 
                    into a retreat — a warm bubble bath that sparkles like champagne, silky lotions that melt into the 
                    skin like liquid sunshine, and soothing face masks that feel as refreshing as morning dew. With candles 
                    flickering and soft music playing, it's a little pocket of peace where she can unwind and be pampered 
                    anytime she wants.

                    <p>
                    This is a great example of solving one of Andrea's everyday mysteries — how she can literally never 
                    find a pair of tweezers or nail clippers when she needs them. A fresh set means no more digging through 
                    drawers or borrowing mine; just a simple, reliable fix that makes her self-care routine smoother and way 
                    less frustrating.

                    <p>
                    This is a great example of how much Andrea loves her massages — she asks for them all the time! A massage 
                    table means she can finally have her very own spa setup at home, complete with her own personal servant 
                    (me) ready to give a de-stressing massage on beck and call. It's comfort, relaxation, and a little luxury 
                    all rolled into one.

                    <p>
                    This is a great example of supporting Andrea's latest hobby — birding. She's been talking about getting 
                    a nice pair of binoculars (to say the least), and with them she can spot every flutter and feather in 
                    crystal clarity. She loves the thrill of finding new birds, identifying them, and adding each one to her 
                    growing list of discoveries. A gift like this helps her turn simple walks into little adventures full of 
                    wonder.

                style="border: 10px solid blueviolet; border-radius: 20px;">
                    <p>
                    This is a great example of how Andrea's eyes light up with pure joy whenever she sees a new set of Dungeons 
                    & Dragons dice. The sparkle of the colors, the weight in her hand, and the little stories behind each roll 
                    make the game even more magical for her. A fresh set of dice isn't just a gift — it's another way to see that 
                    unmistakable excitement in her smile

                        <p>
                        This is a great example of Andrea's love for gardening and flowers. There's nothing she enjoys more than 
                        tending to her plants and watching new blooms appear. Having a good set of tools makes all the difference 
                        — turning the hard work into something smooth and enjoyable, and letting her spend more time surrounded 
                        by the colors and scents she loves most.

                        <p>
                        This is a great example of Andrea's perfect rainy day — curled up in extreme comfort with a good book for 
                        hours. A reading lounge chair gives her that cozy spot she loves, where the sound of rain outside, a warm 
                        blanket, and the pages of her favorite story all come together to make the day feel magica   
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        This is a great example of Andrea's love for games she can share with her dad. She's spent hours playing 
                        darts with him, laughing and competing, and it's something that always brings her joy. Gifts like this 
                        remind her of those special moments and keep that shared love of games alive.

                        <p>
                        This is a great example of Andrea's hopes and dreams for the future — becoming a mom. While we're not 
                        pregnant yet, we have high hopes for baby Cormier in the months to come. Gifts like this are little 
                        reminders of the love, excitement, and anticipation we already feel as we look forward to starting our 
                        family together.

            <h2>If you <B>REALLY</B> can't land on one...</h2>
                <p> Andrea loves putting me to work on various projects. A gift card to Home Depot could go a long way to making her home relaxation
                    dreams come true!!
